	<h1>Hello!</h1>

	<p>
	Presumably you've come to this page to learn a little more about me. Thank you! That's very kind. Well, here you go!
	</p>


	<p>
		I was born in the sunny town of Calabasas, California, home of the Kardashians and The Cheesecake Factory Headquarters.* The son of a small town librarian and a Swiss expat, I quickly found joy in making others laugh and begging for attention.
	</p>

	<p>
		After a relatively quaint childhood I moved out to New York City to attend NYU's Tisch School of the arts for acting. I fell in love with the city and have lived on gorgeous, weird Roosevelt Island since.
	</p>

	<p>
		In my spare time I love to write and perform strange comedy in basements, kick a soccer ball around the island, and go to screenings of bad and cult movies. Other times you can find me staring wistfully and the sun over the water, meditating on the nature of all things.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fun Fact: I've had 3 wisdom tooth surgeries!
