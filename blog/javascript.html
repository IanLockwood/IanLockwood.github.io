	<h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>

	<p>Oh Javascript. How you tantalize me with your objects that look just like Ruby except slightly different. Every day you push me closer to the grave.
	</p>

	<p>
	Here's the difference:
	</p>
	<p>
	A Ruby hash...
	</p>

	<p>
		looks like this:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				people_and_my_impressions_of_them = {
				Ryan: "Totally lame",
				Jan: "Super tough",
				Alan: "Get this guy some deodorant",
				Rick: "Great shorts but he wouldn't tell me where he got them"
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
	This is how you access one:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				people_and_my_impressions_of_them[:Jan]
				#=> Super tough
			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		And finally, here's how you add to one:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				people_and_my_impressions_of_them[:Kyle] = "What a guy!"
			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		There are, of course, many different ways to do earch of those things. But I'll leave you with that for now so we can move onto JavaScript!
	</p>

	<p>
		Here's what a JavaScript object looks like:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				var people_and_my_impressions_of_them = {
				ryan: "Totally lame";
				jan: "Super tough";
				alan: "Get this guy some deodorant";
				rick: "Great shorts but he wouldn't tell me where he got them";
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		Pretty similar, right? WRONG. LEAVE.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sorry, I just... JavaScript can be frustrating, guys. Where was I? Ah yes, how to access them:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				console.log(people_and_my_impressions_of_them.jan)

				or

				console.log(people_and_my_impressions_of_them[jan])

				#=> Super tough
			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		Adding to one or changing one:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				people_and_my_impressions_of_them.mike = "What a snooze!"
			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		And deleting from one:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				delete people_and_my_impressions_of_them.mike
			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		Now this is all great, but the difference isn't all syntax. With Ruby hashes, you're creating a list of keys and values. You're doing the same with JavaScript, but in a way, a JavaScript object lends itself better to categories with values. This is because of the easy, custom functions that you define, like ".mike" above. As a result, you might use multiple JavaScript objects with descriptive values. Here's an example of what that might look like, and how you might manipulate them:
	</p>

	<p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				var ian = {
				name: "Ian";
				age: 22;
				opinion: "THE BEST"
				};

				var albert = {
				name: "Albert";
				age: "101";
				opinion: "What an old fart"
				};

				var jan = {
				name: "Jan"
				age: "52"
				opinion: "Seriously, she's the best."
				};


				ian.mood "Sad";
				albert.opinion = "Rest in Peace";
				jan.opinion = "alleged murderer";



				#=> 
				var ian = {
				name: "Ian";
				age: 22;
				opinion: "THE BEST"
				mood: "Sad"
				};

				var albert = {
				name: "Albert";
				age: "101";
				opinion: "Rest in Peace"
				};

				var jan = {
				name: "Jan"
				age: "52"
				opinion: "alleged murderer"
				};

			</code>
		</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		In <i>my</i> opinion, the biggest difference between Ruby hashes and Javascript objects is this: Hashes are easy to make, whereas objects are easy to manipulate.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks guys! See you next week.
