  <h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>

      I'm excited for DBC! But I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, and I'm still not, but Shareef's video was very informative. I'm definitely experiencing both of the fears he described - everything he said was pretty spot on.
    </p>

    <p>
      My impression of the "DBC experience" is perhaps less cynical than others in some ways and more so in other ways. I went to experimental theatre school, so I'm totally behind yoga and mindfulness meditation, and anything else that some people might think are floaty or unnecessary. I've seen the tangible results of those sorts of practices. DBC has a HUGE emphasis on working together, probably more than I've ever had, and I'm really interested to see how that works. The kitchen analogy was very interesting and gave me a little more insight into that.

      On the other hand, I'm hoping to hear more about business and employment. I believe everything that DBC has told me, but despite being an artsy person I take comfort in numbers. The theatre school was actually really brainwash-y, so I know the importance of drawing your own conclusions from evidence, rather than taking the word of someone who can benefit financially from you. That said, after seeing how legitimate the curriculum is and talking with DBC people, I'm pretty darn confident in the program, I'm less focused on the final result, and I'm just excited to jump in.

    <p>
      My impression of DBC is the reason I chose it instead of another programming school, and it's been solidified now. DBC cares so much about making sure you learn as much as you possibly can, and that's their #1 goal. They're constantly improving their curriculum and know that practices like yoga and mindfulness meditation can aid the learning process. And to be honest, I like that they're willing to ask people to leave and give them a refund. It shows discipline, a commitment to quality, and that money isn't always the priority, and I appreciate that. And of course, they let people repeat phases; they're not monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like I said, I can definitely engage with this culture. But I bet there are a lot of cultural things coming up, maybe on the other extreme, that I'll have trouble with. I'm somewhat nervous to face those challenges, but I'm also eager and excited.
    </p>

    <p>
      My expectations of DBC haven't changed, they've just sort of solidified, and DBC is proving that it can meet them. I'm really excited to participate in this kind of learning environment, though of course it makes me a little nervous. But I'm itching to keep delving into the unknown and learn as much as I can!
