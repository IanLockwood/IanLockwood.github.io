	<h1>Cultural Discussion: Diversity in Tech</h1>

	<p>
		For such a modern industry, the lack of diversity in tech is a surprisingly large problem. Not only are women and minorities less hired than their white, male counterparts, they also often leave due to discriminatory and cultural reasons.
	</p>

	<p>
		For this post I did a lot of varied research, but would like to point to these two articles:
		<br><i>Hacking Tech&apos;s Diversity Problem</i> by Joan C. Williams on <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/hacking-techs-diversity-problem"><b>Harvard Business Review</b></a> and <i>The Lack Of Diversity In Tech Is A Cultural Issue</i> by Bonnie Marcus on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2015/08/12/the-lack-of-diversity-in-tech-is-a-cultural-issue/"><b>Forbes</b></a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Part of the problem is tradition. White dudes hire white dudes. It's pretty normal - but it shouldn't be. And once hired, the problems don't stop. Often, women and minorities in the tech workplace experience gender, sexual, or racial discomfort (or all of those); feel that they have more to prove than their white, male colleagues; go through constant micro-(and plenty of the time, macro-)discrimination; and see less pay.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what should we do? That's a tricky and huge question, but take a look at some suggestions from Bonnie Marcus from her Forbes article:
		<blockquote cite="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2015/08/12/the-lack-of-diversity-in-tech-is-a-cultural-issue/">

			"To realize their diversity goals, companies must address their cultural issues. Those organizations that recognize the bias and unfair workplace practices can design customized programs to help retain their talented employees. I have some suggestions for those companies that are committed to this initiative.
			</p>
			<p>
			First, retain an outside firm to do a thorough assessment of the culture of the organization including discrimination in pay and hiring practices. Secure senior leadership commitment to a corrective action plan that addresses gender and racial issues. Without senior leadership sponsorship these programs often fail.
			</p>
			<p>
			Second, offer mandatory training in unconscious bias for every employee. I think Pinterest is on the right track including this initiative in their diversity plan. It is imperative that all employees at every level of the organization understand their own bias and subsequent behavior.
			</p>
			<p>
			Third, develop career paths that enable employees to see their potential advancement opportunities. Without a clearly defined plan and support, talented employees lose interest and leave believing the company is not invested in their success.
			</p>
			<p>
			Fourth, develop specific coaching and training programs for women and minorities on relational skills such as strategic networking and relationship building, negotiation, consensus building and self-promotion with the goal of guiding employees to create visibility, credibility, and influence within their organization.
			</p>
			<p>
			Fifth, create mentor programs with the goal of helping women and minorities understand the politics and culture of their organization and specifically hone their political skill. Mentors must be committed to giving frank, honest assessments of the company environment along with strategies for positioning themselves. Mentors must also be committed to helping mentees build a critical support network of allies and champions.
			</p>
			<p>
			With the increased public awareness of the lack of diversity in technology and other STEM fields, companies will experience more pressure to disclose their statistics and be accountable for reaching diversity objectives. It is time for organizations to address their cultural bias and create initiatives to retain women and minorities. Addressing bias in workplace practices along with providing employees with the tools to survive and thrive in the workplace will have a positive impact on diversity."
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		All great suggestions. On top of all of this, there have been some great results with blind hiring, and in one study by adding the words "salary negotiable" to job listings, the negotiation gap between men and women was closed and the pay gap was reduced by 45% (Williams).
	</p>
	<p>
		It's thousands of experiments like these, combined with a constant and aggressive devotion to figuring out how to fix this problem, that will find the solution.

<!-- 
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was fun and artistic! For the most part we worked on our individual wireframes - I assume if we were working on the same one it would have required a lot more discussion.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I do find it helpful. Checking my wireframe is a great way to keep me organized and on-task, and I always have a reference for what my site should look like.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
Simplicity, readability, and clarity. We both liked wireframes that look "clean"

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I hadn't actually used section or nav yet, so implementing them was fun.
