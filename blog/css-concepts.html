	<h1>CSS Concepts</h1>
		<p>
			This week's blog assignment is a good opportunity for me to learn the difference between inline and inline-block, as I have <i>no idea</i> what the difference is. Both are inline positioning elements that allow you to fill the browser or a container's width. For the layman, that means these are pieces of code that let you place content side-by-side, wherever you want, and the content will stretch to fill the whole screen or however far you want. But what is the difference?
		</p>
		<p>
		Well, it's a few things. But it turns out it's pretty simple. Turns out, an inline-block element is inline, but behaves as a block. But what does that mean?
		</p>

		<p>
		Inline elements allow content to be displayed side-by-side, they can have left and right margins/padding but not top and bottom, and other elements can be placed to their left and right. However, they can't have width or height.
		<br>
		Block elements can have all margins and always have a line break after the block element. They can have width and height, but no content can be placed to their left or right.
		</p>

		<p>
		So inline-block often gives you the best of both worlds. You can have other elements side-by side, all margins and padding, and height and width. 
		</p>

		<p>
		But that doesn't mean you would always want to use inline-block. Inline-block is can be complex overkill for simpler elements, like navigation bars, footers and headers. However, if you had, say, a gallery of pictures of varying sizes that you'd like to be side-by-side and the same size, inline-block would be the way to go.
