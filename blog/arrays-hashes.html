	<h1>Arrays vs Hashes: Say what?</h1>
	
	<p>
		This week in DBC Phase 0 we've dealt with a lot of arrays and hashes. But what are they? What makes them tick? What's the difference? And why might you use one over the other?
	</p>

	<p>
		Well here's the difference:
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Arrays</b> are lists. They hold an ordered number of things. Here's what a ruby array might look like:
		<pre><code>
			very_cool_array = [1, 9, "Ian", "hello"]
		</code></pre>
		As you can see, the array is surrounded in brackets, can include numbers and strings, and is one-dimensional. It must start with a lowercase letter or underscore.
		<br>
		A value from the pair can be accessed by indexing the array, like so:
		<pre><code>
			puts very_cool_array[0]

			puts very_cool_array[3]

			1

			"hello"
		</code></pre>
		You'll notice that in an array we start in position 0.
	</p>
<br>
	<p>
		<b>Hashes</b> are lists or directories where a key is assigned to a value. To use a very popular analogy, it's like a dictionary where the key is the word and the value is a definition. Hashes are two-dimensional. Like arrays, they must start with a lowercase letter or underscore, but hashes are usually surrounded in curly brackets - these: {}. Here's how you might make a hash:
		<pre><code>
			great_hash = { "Key" => "value", "fingers" => 10, , "toes" => "Nine, now." }
		</code></pre>
		or, using symbols:
		<pre><code>
			great_hash = { :Key => "value", :fingers => 10, , :toes => "Nine, now." }
		</code></pre>
		or, using the Hash.new method:
		<pre><code>
			great_hash = Hash.new
			great_hash["Key"] = "value"
		</code></pre>
		As you can see, there are a few ways to do it. Hashes used to be unordered, but as of a recent update to Ruby, they are now ordered. 
	</p>

<br>
	<p>
		<b>So when would you want to use a hash and when would you want to use an array?</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		Well it's case by case, but the differences inform us. Hashes are a great way to have parameters in functions (I can't take credit, I have to thank ruby-docs for that concise explanation). The pairs are a great way to represent data structures, and you can manipulate them. You could have a dictionary saved as a hash, or your personal schedule (maybe like this - {"10/1/15 8PM" => "Dance Contest"}), and manipulate and change it as you see fit.
	</p>
	<p>
		Arrays, on the other hand, are a great, simple way to store data, and should be used if you really don't need a hash. The data in arrays is easier to manipulate quickly, and you can write arrays into methods much more easily. If you were thinking of using a hash and realize that you could use one key for all of the values, just make that key the name of an array and fill it with those values.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm getting a lot of hints from all of my readings that there are a lot of cool, vital, advanced functions of hashes, so I'm sure there are some other great ways you would want to use them. I'm sure I'll find out soon!
	</p>

		Until next week,
		Ian
