	<h1>What is Rails?</h1>

	<p>
	It seems I've always been fuzzy on what Rails (or Ruby on Rails) is. I knew the term long before DBC, but never understood what it was. So for this post I decided to really jump in and figure out what the heck it is!
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, the basics are fairly simple. Ruby is a framework, based on Ruby, for building web applications. Rails is NOT a programming language like Ruby; it's simply a guide and list of shortcuts for writing app code efficiently and cleanly. Rails is super object-oriented, as it is based on Ruby.
	</p>

	<p>
		Rails was created in 2004 by David Heinemeier Hansson, often affectionately referred to as DHH. It was created just about 10 years after the creation of Ruby (1993). Is this vital to know? No, but hey - credit where credit is due.
	</p>

	<p>
		Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework, which sounds complicated but just describes how the user interacts with the app. The user sees the view and uses the controller, the controller manipulates the model, and the model updates the view.
	</p>

	<p>
		Rails emphasizes and enforces best practices, which is one of the reasons it is so efficient. It promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and a principle called Convention Over Configuration. Convention Over Configuration means that Rails defaults to a set of conventions that are considered, at least within Rails, to be the best way of doing things.
	</p>

	<p>
		Rails interplays with different servers (including its own) fluidly and flexibly, which makes it a versatile and customizable framework.
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, RubyGems is worth mentioning as it has an interesting relationship to Rails. RubyGems are basically shortcuts and plugins for Ruby and Rails, and Rails itself is actually a RubyGem.
	</p>

		I hope this has been helpful to anyone reading who is (or was) confused about Rails! Thank you for reading!
