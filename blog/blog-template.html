<!-- 
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was fun and artistic! For the most part we worked on our individual wireframes - I assume if we were working on the same one it would have required a lot more discussion.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I do find it helpful. Checking my wireframe is a great way to keep me organized and on-task, and I always have a reference for what my site should look like.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
Simplicity, readability, and clarity. We both liked wireframes that look "clean"

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I hadn't actually used section or nav yet, so implementing them was fun.
