- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

A ton. Mostly that they are your best friend for web design. I now totally understand padding - I got it before, but didn't really know where I'd be using it.

- What did you learn about CSS positioning?

Again, a lot. I mostly learned that it's tricky and I don't fully understand any of it. But I'm getting there!

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Everything that I had put in tables before was SO easy to work with. I LOVE TABLES. I had a lot of trouble getting my nav bar to look right - I had to spend a lot of time researching.

- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It's great and horrible. It's really easy and really hard. It's simple and it's not simple and there's way too much information to comprehend. I don't know what to talk about specifically, I'm a little bit rattled.
